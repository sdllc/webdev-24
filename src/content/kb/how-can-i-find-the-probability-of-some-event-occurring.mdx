You have some trigger event in your model that is either true or false.
How can you find the probability that this event happens (or doesn't happen)?

The trick is to use this event to set some other cell to zero or one, using
an `IF` function. Here, I am checking whether the market return is greater than 
zero (in cell `C6`). I turn that into a 1 or 0 in cell `C7`:

<Spreadsheet doc='/docs/event-probability.json' />

After running a simulation, the average value will equal the 
probability of that event happening during the simulation. You can use the 
`SimulationMean` function to get the average value (in cell `C9`).

Why does that work? It's the same as counting up all the times during the
simulation that the event was true, and then dividing it by the total number
of trials -- this is the probability.
