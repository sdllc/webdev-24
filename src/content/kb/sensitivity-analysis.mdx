Single-factor sensitivity is a useful way to understand risk in a model.  You 
can look at single-factor sensitivity using the R-squared (R2) value from a 
linear regression; this is also called the *coefficient of determination*.

The R2 value will tell you how much of the variance in the model is explained 
by variance in one or more of the inputs to the model.  The add-in function 
`SimulationRSquared` returns the R2 statistic for an *independent* value and 
a *dependent* value.

The *independent* value is the input -- generally one of the random variables 
in your model.  The *dependent* value is the output -- the result of the model.  

Another way to think about this is that the result *depends on* the input.

Use the `SimulationRSquared` function to create a table of R2 values for your 
model, and then add a donut chart for a visual representation.
