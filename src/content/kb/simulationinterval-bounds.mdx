The `SimulationInterval` function returns the portion of a simulation -- as a percentage -- that falls within some bounds.

If you omit one of the bounds, then the function will return the portion that falls above (or below) the given bound.  For example,

```
=SimulationInterval(A1,0,1)
```

returns the portion of the simulation that falls within 0 and 1, inclusive.

```
=SimulationInterval(A1,0)
```

returns the portion of the simulation that is greater than or equal to zero (only the first bound is provided); and 

```
=SimulationInterval(A1,,0)
```

returns the portion of the simulation that is less than or equal to zero (note the empty parameter -- the comma must still be provided).

The bounds are inclusive, meaning that in the first example, it returns results in which `0 <= A1 <= 1`.  This has some implications for creating tables.  

For continuous variables, it is very unlikely that you will have an exact value 0 or 1, so this is functionally equivalent to `0 < A1 < 1`.  Therefore when creating a table, you can use sets of ascending values.
For example, you could create a table:

<Spreadsheet class="short" doc="/docs/simulation-interval-1.json" />

However for discrete values, you may have exact matches.  In that event, you 
should create a table using only one parameter (minimum or maximum, depending 
on your application) and subtract.

<Spreadsheet class="short" doc="/docs/simulation-interval-2.json" />
